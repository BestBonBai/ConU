# Data structures:
+ make code cleaner, easier to understand.
+ create fast algorithm

## ADT (Abstract data type) vs Data structure:
+ ADT is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must be implemented. But it does not provide detail in what programming language.

## Complexity Analysis:
+ Ask questions of
	- how much time and space of an algorithm to run?

+ Big-O Notation:
	- Only care about the performance in the **worst case**. The input size becomes arbitrarily large.
	=> Ignore constant when calculating Big-O.
	O(n + c) = O(n) *Ignore the constant c*
	O(cn) = O(n), c > 0
