\section{Problem description:}
Consider a DB schema consisting of the following relation schemes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Regions} (\underline{\textbf{Region\_ID}}, Region\_Name)
    \item \textbf{Countries} (\underline{\textbf{Country\_id}}, Country\_Name, Region\_Id)
    \item \textbf{Locations} (\underline{\textbf{Location\_Id}}, Street\_address, Postal\_code, City, State\_Province, Country\_Id)
    \item \textbf{Jobs} (\underline{\textbf{Job\_Id}},  Job\_title, Min\_Salary, Max\_salary)
    \item \textbf{Departments} (\underline{\textbf{Dep\_Id}},  Dep\_Name, Manager\_Id,
Location\_Id)
    \item \textbf{Employees} (\underline{\textbf{Emp\_ID}},  FirstName, Last\_Name, E-mail,
Phone\_number, Hire\_date, Job\_Id, Salary, Comsn\_pct,
Manager\_Id, Dep\_Id)
    \item \textbf{Employee\_History} (\underline{\textbf{Emp\_ID}, \textbf{Joining\_date}}, last\_date, Job\_ID, Dep\_ID)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Keys are underlined} \\
Now, express the following queries in Relational Algebra (You are not allowed to use
aggregate functions):

\newpage
\subsection{Query 1.}
\subsubsection{Description}
Find the FirstName, LastName, email, phone number, hire date and salary of
employees currently working in the research and development department.
\subsubsection{Relational Algebra}
\begin{align*}
\pi_{\substack{
        \text{FirstName, Last\_Name,} \\ 
        \text{E-mail, Phone\_number,}\\
        \text{Hire\_date, Salary}
    }
}
(\sigma_{\text{Dep\_Name="Research and Development"}} (\text{Departments } \bowtie\text{ Employees})  )
\end{align*}


\subsection{Query 2.}
\subsubsection{Description}
Find the FirstName and LastName of employees who are currently working in
Canada but have never worked in the United States.
\subsubsection{Relational Algebra}
\begin{align*}
    &\rho_{A}(\pi_{FirstName, Last\_Name} (\sigma_{\text{Country\_Name = "Canada"}} (Employees \bowtie Departments \bowtie Locations \bowtie Countries)  )) \\
    &\rho_{B}(\pi_{FirstName, Last\_Name} (\sigma_{\text{Country\_Name = "United States"}} \\
    &(Employees \bowtie Employee\_History \bowtie Departments \bowtie Locations \bowtie Countries)  )) \\
    & A - B
\end{align*}

\newpage
\subsection{Query 3.}
\subsubsection{Description}
Find the FirstName, LastName and Department Name of employees who are
currently managers of a department in which they have never worked in the past
for the department they are currently managing.
\subsubsection{Relational Algebra}

\begin{align*}
&\rho_{Dept} (\pi_{Dep\_Id, Dep\_Name} (Departments)) \\
&\rho_{(A)} (\pi_{\substack{
    \text{FirstName} \\
    \text{Last\_Name} \\
    \text{Dep\_Name}
    }}
    (\sigma_{Employees.Manager\_Id = Emp\_ID} (\text{Employees } \bowtie \text{ Dept}))
    ) \\
&\rho_{EH} (Employees \bowtie_{Employees.Emp\_ID = Employee\_History.Emp\_ID} Employee\_History) \\
&\rho_{B} (\pi_{\substack{
    \text{FirstName} \\
    \text{Last\_Name} \\
    \text{Dep\_Name}
    }
}
(\sigma_{Employees.Dep\_Id = Employee\_History.Dep\_Id} (\text{Employees } \bowtie \text{ EH })) ) \\
&A - B
\end{align*}

\subsection{Query 4.}
\subsubsection{Description}
Find the Job Title and the maximum salary of all jobs that have the max salary as
the highest salaries among all other jobs.
\subsubsection{Assumption}
\textbf{Assume the question is asking for the highest Max\_salary in Jobs}
\subsubsection{Relational Algebra}
\begin{align*}
&\rho_{\text{ TOTAL}} (\pi_{Job\_title, Max\_salary} (Jobs)) \\
&\rho_{A} (TOTAL) \\
&\rho_{\text{ B}} (\pi_{Max\_salary} (Jobs)) \\
&\rho_{C} (\pi_{Job\_title, A.Max\_salary} (A \bowtie_{A.Max\_salary < B.Max\_salary} B)) \\
& TOTAL - C
\end{align*}

\newpage
\subsection{Query 5.}
\subsubsection{Description}
Find the department name of all the departments that are located in the region of
North America
\subsubsection{Relational Algebra}
\begin{align*}
    &\pi_{Dep\_Name} (\sigma_{\text{Region\_Name = "North America"}} (Departments \bowtie Locations \bowtie Countries \bowtie Regions) )
\end{align*}

\subsection{Query 6.}
\subsubsection{Description}
Find the FirstName and LastName of employees who worked on all jobs
throughout their lifetime (from first day of work till today if they are still
working)
\subsubsection{Assumption}
\textbf{Assuming the question asks for people who have worked at every job in the Jobs relation before}
\subsubsection{Relational Algebra}
\begin{align*}
    &\pi_{FirstName, Last\_Name} ((Jobs \bowtie (Employees \bowtie Employee\_History) ) \div (\pi_{Job\_Id} Jobs))
\end{align*}

\subsection{Query 7.}
\subsubsection{Description}
Find the FirstName and LastName of employees who throughout their career
worked in all the locations that are located in the province of Quebec.
\subsubsection{Relational Algebra}
\begin{align*}
    & \rho_{A} ( \\
    &\pi_{FirstName, Last\_Name} ( \\
    &\sigma_{State\_Province = "Quebec"} (Employees \bowtie Employee\_History \bowtie Departments \bowtie Locations))) \\
    & \rho_{B} ( \\
    &\pi_{FirstName, Last\_Name} ( \\
    &\sigma_{State\_Province \neq "Quebec"} (Employees \bowtie Employee\_History \bowtie Departments \bowtie Locations))) \\
    & A - B
\end{align*}
