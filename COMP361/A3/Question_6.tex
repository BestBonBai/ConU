\label{sec:bonus_a_modified_newton_s_method_}

\textbf{Problem:}\\
The \textbf{multiplicity} of the zero $x^*$ is the least integer \textit{m} such that  $f^(k)*(x^*) = 0$ for  $0 \le k < m$, but $f^(m)*(x^*) \neq 0.$
Show analytically that in the case of a zero of multiplicity m, the \textbf{modified Newton's method:}
\\
$x_{n+1}$ = $x_{n} - m* (\frac{f(x_{n})}{f'(x_{n})})$\\
 is quadratically convergent.

 \textbf{Answer:}
 Let $g(x) = (x-m)^{k}h(x)$, with $h(m) \neq 0$.
 Substitue g'(x) and g''(x) into the Newton's method |f'(x)|.\\
 Substitue m into the function to get |f'(m)| = 0 $\implies$ The function converges quadratically
