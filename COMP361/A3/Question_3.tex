\section{Iteration of discrete logistic equation}%

\textbf{Problem:}
\\
Consider the \textit{discrete logistic equation}
$x^{k+1} = cx^{k} (1-x^{k})$, k = 0, 1, 2, 4,\ldots
\\
For each of the following values of c, determine analytically the fixed points and whether they are attracting or repelling: c = 0.70, c = 1.00, c = 1.80, c = 2.00, c = 3.30, c = 3.50, c = 3.97. (You need only consider “physically meaningful” fixed points, namely those that lie in the interval [0, 1].)
If a fixed point is attracting then determine analytically if the convergence is linear or quadratic.
If the convergence is linear then analytically determine the rate of convergence.
For each case include a statement that describes the behavior of the iterations
\\
