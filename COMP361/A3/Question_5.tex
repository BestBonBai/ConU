\label{sec:newton_s_method_to_find_sqrt_r_}

\textbf{Problem:}
Newton's method to find $\sqrt(R)$ is:\\
\\
$x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2} (x_n + \frac{R}{x_n})$ \\
\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Perform three iterations of scheme (1) for computing $\sqrt(2)$, starting with $x_0 = 1$.
    \item Perform three iterations of the bisection method for computing $\sqrt(2)$, starting with interval [1,2].
    \item Find theoretically the minimum number of iterations in both schemes to achieve $10^6$ accuracy.
    \item Find numerically the minimum number of iterations in both schemes to achieve $10^6$ accuracy and compare your results with the theoretical estimates.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Solution:}
