\textbf{Problem}
\\
Consider the example of solving a system of nonlinear equations by Newtonâ€™s method, as given on Pages 95 to 97 of the Lecture notes. 
Write a program to carry out this iteration, using Gauss elimination to solve the 2 by 2 linear systems
that arise.
Use each of the following 16 initial data sets for the Newton iteration:
\\
\\
($x_{1}^{0}, x_{2}^{0}$) = (i, j),\\
$i = 0, 1, 2, 3, $\\
 $j = 0, 1, 2, 3$.\\
 \\
Present and discuss your numerical results in a concise manner.
