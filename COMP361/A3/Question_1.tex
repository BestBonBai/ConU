\label{sec:newton_s_method_to_compute_the_cube_root_of_6}

\textbf{Problem:}
Show how to use Newton’s method to compute the cube root
of 5. Numerically carry out the first 10 iterations of Newton’s method, using $x_{0}$ = 1. 
Analytically determine the fixed points of the Newton iteration and determine whether they are attracting or repelling.
If a fixed point is attracting then determine analytically if the convergence is linear or quadratic.
Draw the “$x_{k+1}$ versus $x_{k}$ diagram”, again taking $x_{0} = 1$, and draw enough iterations in the diagram, so that the long time behavior is clearly visible. 
For which values of $x_{0}$ will Newton’s method converge?
