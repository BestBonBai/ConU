\section{Question 3}
\subsection{Problem}
Derive the local Three-point Gauss Quadrature Formula for integrating a function f(x) over
the reference interval [−1, 1]. (This formula uses the roots of the orthogonal polynomial
$e_{3}(x)$.) \\
Use the corresponding composite formula to integrate the function $f(x) = \sin (\pi x)$ over the interval [0, 1], using N = 2, 4, 8, 16, · · · , equally spaced subintervals in [0, 1]. List the observed errors (the difference between the numerical integral and the exact integral) in a Table. \\
How many function evaluations are needed for the error to be less than $10^(−7)$? \\
