\section{User versus kernel threads models}
\subsection{Problems:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the main differences between the user-kernel threads models? 
    \item Which one of these models is likely to trash the system if used without any constraints? 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Answer:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Two main differences are:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item User-level threads are unknown by the kernel, whereas the kernel is aware of kernel threads
            \item Kernel threads need not be associated with a process whereas every user thread belongs to a process
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
