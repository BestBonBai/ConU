# Explaination for the behaviour 
The running time is varied between these three test cases since running time of multithreading program depends on stages of the machine at the time. Different specs or diffrent states (such as the number of program running on the machine at the moment, or ) will produce a unique result each time since the CPU is occupied differently.
