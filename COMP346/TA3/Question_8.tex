\section{Automatically open file scheme}
\subsection{Problem:}
Some systems automatically open a file when it is referenced for the first time and close the file
when the job terminates. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this scheme as compared
to the more traditional one, where the user has to open and close the file explicitly.

\subsection{Answer:}
Automatic opening and closing of files relieves the user from the invocation of these functions, and thus makes it more convenient to the user; however, it requires more overhead than the case where explicit opening and closing is required. \\
