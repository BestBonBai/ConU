\section{Advantages and Disadvantages of  a global page replacement algorithm}
\subsection{Problems:}
Explain (i) an advantage and (ii) a disadvantage that a global page replacement algorithm has
over a local page replacement algorithm.

\subsection{Answer:}
Advantage of Global replacement algo over local replacement algorithm:\\

Working set of High priority process can grow and shrink as it can be allocated more or less frame accordingly, so high priority process cant get interuption, it lead to overally high throughput of system. \\

Disadvantage of Global replacement algo over local replacement algorithm
1.Page fault ratio of a process can be affected by other process also.
