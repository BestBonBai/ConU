\section{Advantages of scheduling quantum}
\subsection{Problem}
What advantage is there in having different values of the scheduling quantum on different levels
of a multilevel feedback queuing system? Your answer should consider all aspects such as
fairness, starvation, efficiency, etc.

\subsection{Answer}
A process which doesn't need for frequent servicing may get queue up with the larger quantum, as for the smaller quantum, the queue is formed with a process which does need the servicing frequently. So that the processing of the computer might works more efficiently because,  it might only need the fewer context switches.as for the process completion
