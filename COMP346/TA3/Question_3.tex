\section{Calculate EAT}
\subsection{Problem:}
Consider a demand-paged system where the page table for each process resides in main memory. In
addition, there is a fast associative memory (also known as TLB which stands for Translation Look-aside
Buffer) to speed up the translation process. Each single memory access takes 1 microsecond while each
TLB access takes 0.2 microseconds. Assume that 2\% of the page requests lead to page faults, while 98\%
are hits. On the average, page fault time is 20 milliseconds (includes everything: TLB/memory/disc access
time and transfer, and any context switch overhead). Out of the 98\% page hits, 80 \% of the accesses are
found in the TLB and the rest, 20\%, are TLB misses. Calculate the effective memory access time for the
system.

\subsection{Answer:}
\textbf{Effective Memory Access Time} = \\
TLB hit ratio * (TLB access time + Main memory access time) + (1 â€“ hit ratio) * (TLB access time + 2 * main memory access time)

TLB hit ratio = (TLB hits) / (Number of queries into TLB)

= $\frac{80}{98}$ = 0.816

Effective Memory Access Time is

\begin{align*}
    = \frac{80}{98} * (0.2+1)+(1-(\frac{80}{98}))*(0.2+2*1) \\
= (0.816*1.2)+(0.184*2.2) \\
= (0.9792 + 0.4048) \\
= 1.384 \text{ Microseconds}
\end{align*}
