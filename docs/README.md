## INTRO:
This repository is where I upload my finished works at school, and where I share my personal tips as a Computer Science student at Concordia University. If you are a new student, then I hope this would help you prepare for your own journey. 
You are a beginner in tech industry? Welcome! I hope this could help you form a basic idea of what to be expected in a general Comp/Sci program since most Comp/Sci programs around the world all following a more or less the same structure. 
Also, worth to notice that I do not own the copyright of the actual materials represented in class; thus, the contents in this repository are either my own works or my implementation of the assignments.

## [COMP&SOEN courses:](../docs/COMPcoures/README.md)
My degree is in Computer Science; thus, my course schedule is a combination of COMP (computer science), or SOEN (software engineering), with some electives in MATH(math), or PHYS (physic). This section is dedicated for my core courses of COMP, and SOEN.

## Other courses:
Along with the core mandatory classes, I have many other electives to do. Sometimes, the class is extremely fun and enjoyable.
