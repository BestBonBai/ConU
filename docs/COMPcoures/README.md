## COMP courses:
### COMP 228: System hardwares:

> DESCRIPTION: Levels of system abstraction and von Neumann model. Basics of digital logic design. Data representation and manipulation. Instruction set architecture. Processor internals. Assembly language programming. Memory subsystem and cache management. I/O subsystem. Introduction to network organization and architecture.

This is an introductory class of system hardwares. We learn the basic concept of computer architecture. However, since my degree is in Comp/Sci, there is a slightly cut in the hand-on practise to fit the nature of computer scientist.

### COMP 248: OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING I:
> DESCRIPTION: Introduction to programming. Basic data types, variables, expressions, assignments, control flow. Classes, objects, methods. Information hiding, public vs private visibility, data abstraction and encapsulation. References. Arrays. 

This is the first intro to programming class at Concordia. The material of this class mostly focuses on data types, references, and basic concepts of programming such as array, privacy of data, and class. The main language was being used is Java.

### COMP 249: OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING II:
> DESCRIPTION: Design of classes. Inheritance. Polymorphism. Static and dynamic binding. Abstract classes. Exception handling. File I/O. Recursion. Interfaces and inner classes. Graphical user interfaces. Generics. Collections and iterators.

This is the second class, continue from COMP 248. This class focuses on analyzing the Object-Oriented concept of programming language, as well as File I/O, and exception handling. It also introduces the basic concept of recursion. The language was being used is Java.

### COMP 352: DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS:
> DESCRIPTION: Abstract data types: stacks and queues, trees, priority queues, dictionaries. Data structures: arrays, linked lists, heaps, hash tables, search trees. Design and analysis of algorithms: asymptotic notation, recursive algorithms, searching and sorting, tree traversal, graph algorithms. 

This is one of the most important class in a Comp/Sci or Soen degree since it introduces the notion of Time, and Space Complexity along with many different kind of Data Structures. This is one of the most fun and useful class for me personally.
